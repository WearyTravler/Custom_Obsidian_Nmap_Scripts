# Custom_Obsidian_Nmap_Scripts


## Introduction
This repo will hold all the commonly used Nmap scripts but with a twist: The output is in Mark-Down.

What purpose may this server? Easy: I'm studying for the OSCP, and I want my outputs to be easily readable with the most important imformation.

I might add some color coded outputs as well if that's something not already done.

### Current Goals
* Change default output to be readable in MarkDown
* Change common scripts to be readable in MarkDown
* Reference tools that allow nmap xml files to be outputed into MarkDown.
